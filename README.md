# BrainVita
A fun single player game, without graphics. I enjoy it. I hope you will too. :)

# Running the game:

Windows:
 
 -> You need to install some C++ editor like Dev Cpp or Codeblocks to run the cpp code.
 
 -> To run the exe file , just download and run.

Linux: 
 
 -> You must have g++ installed on your system.
